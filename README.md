# Java Object-Oriented Programming Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Java-based applications developed as part of object-oriented programming coursework. The projects focus on applying core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, while also integrating basic data management and user interaction.

Each project represents a standalone system addressing a specific domain, including library management and learning management systems.

## Included Projects

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming Project

This project demonstrates fundamental object-oriented concepts through a structured Java application. It focuses on class design, object interactions, and method abstraction.

Main objectives include:

* Applying OOP principles in Java
* Designing reusable and maintainable classes
* Managing application logic through object collaboration

---

### 2. Learning Management System (Java LMS)

This project is a learning management system developed in Java to manage educational activities such as users, courses, and enrollments.

Typical functionalities include:

* User management (students, instructors, administrators)
* Course creation and enrollment
* Basic tracking of learning activities
* Structured interaction between system components

The project emphasizes modular design and object-oriented architecture.

---

### 3. Library Management System

This project is a library management system designed to handle core library operations.

Key features include:

* Book and resource management
* User registration and management
* Borrowing and returning workflows
* Availability tracking

The system models real-world entities using Java classes and applies object-oriented relationships between them.

---

## Programming Language and Technologies

* Java as the primary programming language
* Object-oriented programming principles
* Console-based or basic graphical user interfaces depending on the project
* File handling or basic persistence where applicable
* UML used during the design phase

---

## UML Design Components

UML diagrams were used to analyze and design the systems before implementation. These may include:

* Class diagrams to represent entities, attributes, and relationships
* Use case diagrams to model user interactions
* Sequence diagrams to illustrate object communication
* Activity diagrams to describe workflows

The UML models help ensure alignment between requirements, design, and implementation.

---

## Project Structure

Each project follows a structured organization similar to:

```
ProjectName/
│
├── src/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── main/
├── uml/
├── docs/
└── README.md
```

Actual folder names may vary depending on the specific project.

---

## How to Run the Projects

1. Extract the project folders.
2. Open the project in a Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
3. Ensure a compatible Java Development Kit is installed.
4. Compile and run the main class from the src directory.
5. Interact with the application via the console or interface provided.

---

## Learning Objectives

* Practice object-oriented programming in Java
* Design systems using UML before coding
* Understand class relationships and object collaboration
* Build structured and maintainable Java applications

---

## Limitations

* Projects are primarily academic and focus on core functionality
* Advanced features such as databases, web interfaces, or security may not be included
* Error handling and input validation may be basic

---

## Future Improvements

* Integration with databases for persistence
* Enhanced user interfaces
* Improved exception handling and validation
* Expansion of features based on real-world requirements
